Practice and challenge programs written by Darron Claus-Davis 

As an undergraduate student this repository contains the very first practice program I wrote to my most current understanding and knowledge. I truly enjoy writing programs and solving problems. I look forward to working with an experinced team to help boost my knowledge and understanding with python.
